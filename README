JumpPlus for Bukkit

JumpPlus is a plugin purely designed for allowing double (or multiple) jumping. 

Everything is configurable: both vertical and horizontal speeds, maximum number of jumps, maximum number of free jumps and jump cost(in hunger). In you can easily make a moon jump or a double jump just enough to climb two blocks. 

The default values on the config are for a horizontal speed that basically matches the sprinting jump(3 blocks straight), and vertical velocity to double jump two blocks (on top of the other).
